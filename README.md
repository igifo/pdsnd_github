### Project Title
Exploratory data analysis of bikeshare data

### Description
The project uses R data visualizations to answer three questions about bikeshare data from Washington, Chicago, and New York City:
1. How are durations of trips of up to 1 hour distributed for men and women in New York? Are there significant differences?
2. How is bike usage distributed across hour of day in Chicago? Are there busy / quiet times?
3. Are New York trip numbers and durations different across user age groups?

### Files used
* explore_bikeshare_data.r (code)
* new_york_city.csv (data)
